	<p>I like cats with big pupil. They're adorable and gives me the sense of squishing them. Unfortuantely, I do not own a cat because of the responsiblity that comes along with owning a cat. But one day I would like to own one. As a companion and to reduce stress. Another thing I like is basketball. I love to be physically active and basketball helps me with just that. I like to play people better than me to get better myself.</p>       <! What I like >
